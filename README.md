## Highlights of NANOME pipeline
### Several first highlights for NANOME

![Figure_pipe_comp](https://github.com/LabShengLi/nanome/blob/xgboost1/docs/resources/pipeline_comparison.jpg)

* Enables users to process **terabasescale** Oxford Nanopore sequencing datasets.
* Provide a **one command line**/**web-based UI** for end-to-end analyzing Nanopore sequencing methylation-callings.
* Support **various platform** executions: local, HPC and CloudOS, **without needs for tools' installation** (NANOME support docker and singularity).
* **First standardized whole genome-wide evaluation framework**, considering per-read and per-site performance for singletons/non-singletons, genic and intergenic regions, CpG islands/shores/shelves, different CG densities regions and repetitive regions. 
* The **first Nextflow based DNA methylation-calling pipeline for ONT data**. Please check more articles about Nextflow based workflow technology from Nature Biotechnology: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x and https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3820.
* Allow **add new modules/tools** in simple config txt file, without need to touch the main pipeline codes, supporting rapid development and evaluation.
* Consensus of top performers by XGBoost model, allow NA values.
* Multi-modifications for 5mC and 5hmC.
* Haplotype-awared phasing and allele-specific methylation detection.


## Methodology of NANOME pipeline

[comment]: <> (**Background:** Nanopore long-read sequencing technology greatly expands the capacity of long-range, single-molecule DNA-modification detection. A growing number of analytical tools have been developed to detect DNA methylation from nanopore sequencing reads. Here, we assess the performance of different methylation calling tools to provide a systematic evaluation to guide researchers performing human epigenome-wide studies.)

[comment]: <> (**Results:** We compared several analytic tools for detecting DNA modifications from nanopore long-read sequencing data. We evaluated the CpG methylation-detection accuracy, CpG site coverage, and running time using nanopore sequencing data across different genomic contexts, using natural human DNA. Furthermore, we provide an online DNA methylation database &#40;https://nanome.jax.org&#41; with which to display the DNA methylation levels detected by nanopore sequencing and bisulfite sequencing data across different genomic contexts.)


[comment]: <> (**Conclusions:** Our study is the first benchmark of state-of-the-art methods for detection of mammalian whole-genome DNA-modifications in nanopore sequencing. We provide a broad foundation for cross-platform standardization, and an evaluation of analytical tools designed for genome-scale modified-base detection using nanopore sequencing. )



### CI/CD features
We use  CI Automation Tools to **enable the automated testing on every commit and on PRs** to make sure that updates are not introducing bugs. Please check the automatic testing results on [Github](https://github.com/LabShengLi/nanome/actions).


## System Requirements
### Hardware requirements
NANOME pipeline can be easily configured with different RAM, CPU/GPU resources schema to parallelly run methylation-calling tools. For optimal usage, we recommend running NANOME pipeline on HPC or cloud computing platform, e.g., google cloud platform (GCP). The basic hardware requirements are below:
* GPU or CPU with 2+ cores. 
* RAM: 7+ GB per cpu.
* Storage using HDD or SSD. Please ensure the storage before running the pipeline.


### Software requirements
NANOME pipeline uses Nextflow technology. Users only need to install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) (check the installation guide from https://nf-co.re/usage/installation), and have one of below commonly used environment tool:

## Installation
Users only need to install **Nextflow** (https://nf-co.re/usage/installation). NANOME execution environment will be automatically configured with the support of conda, docker or singularity containers. Below is steps for installing Nextflow:
```angular2html
# Install nextflow
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda nextflow
nextflow -v
```

NANOME pipeline support running with various ways in different platforms:
* Docker
* Singularity
* Conda
* **Local** execution: running directly on default platform
* HPC clusters with **SLURM** support
* Cloud computing platform, e.g., Google Cloud Platform(GCP) with **google-lifesciences** support


## Simple usage
Please refer to [Usage](https://github.com/LabShengLi/nanome/blob/master/docs/Usage.md) and [Specific Usage](https://github.com/LabShengLi/nanome/blob/master/docs/SpecificUsage.md) and [NANOME options](https://github.com/LabShengLi/nanome/blob/tutorial1/docs/nanome_params.md) for how to use NANOME pipeline. For running on CloudOS platform (e.g., google cloud), please check [Usage on CloudOS](https://github.com/LabShengLi/nanome/blob/master/docs/Usage.md#5-running-pipeline-on-cloud-computing-platform). We provide a **tutorial video** for running NANOME pipeline:

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/TfotM55KTVE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfotM55KTVE)

When you have Nextflow software, NANOME pipeline can be directly executed without any other additional installation steps:
```angular2html
# Run NANOME via docker
nextflow run LabShengLi/nanome\
    -profile test,docker

# Run NANOME via singularity
nextflow run LabShengLi/nanome\
    -profile test,singularity

# Run NANOME for human data
nextflow run LabShengLi/nanome\
    -profile test_human,[docker/singularity]
```
Please note that above commands are integrated in our **CI/CD test cases**. Our GitHub will automatically test and report results on every commit and PRs (https://github.com/LabShengLi/nanome/actions). 

We firstly proposed the **standardized whole genome-wide evaluation packages**, check [standardized evaluation tool usage](https://github.com/LabShengLi/nanome/blob/master/docs/Eval.md) for more detail. We do not suggest evaluating on a portion of CpGs for performance comparisons.
